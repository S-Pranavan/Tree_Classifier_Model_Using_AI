# Tree_Classifier_Model_Using_AI

Project Title:
Neural Network for Tree Species Classification in University Garden

Project Aim:
The aim of this project is to develop a neural network capable of accurately classifying three visually similar tree species found in the university garden that are challenging to distinguish through visual observation, using data gathered through a field survey(length, width and angle of tip of the leaf). The project emphasizes data collection, model training, and optimization to improve classification accuracy and reliability.

Project Objectives:
Data Collection: Conducting a field survey to gather physical characteristics and relevant data on the three tree species that are challenging to distinguish visually.
Dataset Preparation: Compiling the collected data into a dataset, which will be split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Neural Network Development: Building and training a simple artificial neural network model specifically designed for tree species classification.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Fine-tuning the modelâ€™s hyperparameters to enhance classification accuracy and efficiency.

Techniques Used:
Neural Networks and Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras) for model development and optimization.
Python for data handling, feature engineering, and model training.
Measurement-based feature extraction focused on leaf length over width ratio, and angle.

Outcomes:
Achieved up to 94.44% accuracy in tree species classification.
Improved model performance with techniques like hyperparameter tuning and early stopping.
Developed a generalizable model suitable for environmental management applications.
